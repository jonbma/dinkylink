Next steps:
	-Time Function (difficulty: 1): to display how much time between now and the next train from Princeton or New York
	-Start displaying times after now only (difficulty: 2): remove all values less than the current time. will require client side js as we can't do this from the server
	-Color, jinja2 (difficulty: 2)
	-dinkylink.info rather than dinkylinkversion2.appspot.com (difficulty: 1): need to create google app account
